  <h1>HTML+CSS & Marks+Channels</h1>

  <!-- Use flexbox (definition and examples here) to create a 4-item grid on your webpage. Format the grid such that all items in it are evenly spaced, and wrap.-->

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box">
      <img class="image" src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png" alt="bubble and pie chart">
      <p class="paragraph"> The data types shown by the chart above are items and attributes. Each pie chart represents an item, while the x and y positions of the charts (quantitative), the area/size of the charts (quantitative), and the proportions/percentages the charts are divided up into (categorical segments) are all attributes.The marks used in this visualization are areas of the bubble pie charts as well as the point of the pie chart itself, which indicates information based on its location. These marks are used as items/nodes. The channels used in this chart. The channels are color, which references the different categories used in each pie chart, tilt, which adds information about the percentage/quantity/amount of each of the categories within each pie chart. Furthermore, vertical and horizontal position is another channel used, as the x and y position of each pie chart indicates information about that data. Finally, size, in area, is another channel that conveys information about the data. 
      </p>

    <div class="box">
      <img class="image" src="img/bump_chart.png" alt="bump_chart">
      <p class="paragraph"> The data types shown by the above chart are items and attributes. Each line represents an item over time, while the y position indicates rank, and the x position indicates time. These are both ordered attributes. The marks used in this chart are points which serve as items/nodes, and represent the pieces of information in the visualization. There are also lines that connect the nodes over time (2005-2015). The channels used in this chart are the color of the points and both horizontal and vertical position. The color indicates the different records in the dataset. The changes on vertical position indicate the changes of the rank, while the horizontal position indicates the changes over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <img class="image" src="img/mind_map.png" alt="mind_map">
      <p class="paragraph"> The data type shown in this chart are items, with each bubble representing a node. There are also attributes used such as the color of the notes (categorical) and the title/type of node (theme, category, idea), which is also categorical. The marks used in this chart are mainly the 1D lines that connect the representations of ideas such as images, words, and parts of words. In this case, the line marks are used as links between items. The channels used in this chart are the colors of the connected bubbles in this case, indicating similarity or difference. Position is also a channel used in this chart, both the horizontal and vertical position of the bubbles indicate their association with other representations in the chart. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <img class="image" src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" alt="stacked_bar_chart">
      <p class="paragraph"> The data types shown by the chart are items (A, B, C, D) and attributes (the different colored portions of each bar), which describe the data in the chart. These attributes are categorical. The marks used in this chart are the lines that make up each of the bars on the stacked bar chart. These marks are used as items/nodes. The channels used in this chart are the position (both horizontal and vertical) to indicate the magnitude of each of the bar datas. Another channel used is color, which indicates magnitudes of the different segments/ categories in the data set. </p>
